# Statistical Analysis Project

This is a simple Python project that demonstrates how to perform basic statistical analysis on randomly generated data. The project generates a dataset, calculates basic statistics such as the mean and standard deviation, and visualizes the data in a histogram.

## Features

- Generate random data from a normal distribution
- Compute the mean and standard deviation
- Display a histogram of the data

## Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
